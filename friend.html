<h1>FRIENDS</h1>
<p>Friends have a mutual feelings for one another. They empathize with one another and are willing to support each other to the bitter end. In case of a conflict, they know the extent to which their friends can stretch and respect it rather than fight to win a conversation.</p>
<p>Everyone has at least one best friend, some maybe even more. There are also those people who are just friends and also arch enemies. People may think that just because they are your friends means that they are your best friend. The thing is, even though they are your friend, the relationship between a best friend and a friend is different. Either way regardless of arch enemies, friends or best friends, there are not many ways to compare any of these different types of friends, but you can easily contrast them from one another.</p>

Have you noticed someone who is going through a tough time and does not want to share it? A good option is a close friend with whom you could share your stuff. They share everything without being judged and still manage to use wisdom to get the friend out of a bad situation.  You have nothing to hide from your friend, however ugly the situation may be.

A friend must be someone who keeps your secrets. Even if he or she may be overwhelmed by the burden of your situation, in case he opts to seek advice from a third party, he tactically uses the situation while protecting the identity of the friend.

Friends give you tough love, they do not sugar coat the situation, and instead, they are honest with their opinion and advice for the benefit of your life and relationship. Tough love differentiates honest and dishonest friends.

A good friend is loyal to you to an extent of going an extra mile for the sake of the relationship. If it means taking care of her while in a hospital; there are no set boundaries. This is what makes the relationship memorable. A common saying, “show me your friends and I show you who you are,” The type of friends you keep portrays your character and social status.

Trust and honesty enhance the level of the relationship with your friends. You will talk and share anything with no one to take sides or even judge you. At times, you just require a listening ear even if they do not offer tangible advice or help. It is therapeutic.

You have to be friends before you escalate the relationship to a higher level. Friendship gives you a common ground for you to relate.  What will you talk about when you have nothing to share in common? Some friendships are toxic; the earlier you realize the better for your health before it becomes detrimental to your health.
